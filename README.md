#   Customer Segmentation with K-Means Clustering

This project uses a computer technique to automatically group customers into different categories. This helps businesses understand their customers better and sell them products they're more likely to want.

##   What's the Project About?

Imagine you're trying to sell products online. Some customers spend a lot, some buy frequently, and some leave reviews. If you understand these different types of customers, you can sell to them more effectively.

This project uses a method called **"K-means clustering"** to automatically sort customers into groups based on their behavior. This helps the online store:

* Send the right offers to each customer group.
* Show each group the products they're most interested in.
* Improve the overall shopping experience.

##   What's Included?

* `Customer_Segmentation.ipynb`:   *This is a "digital notebook" that shows all the steps I took to group the customers.* It includes the computer code and explanations.
* `data/E-commerce Customer Behavior.csv`:   *This is the file with the customer data.* It's like a spreadsheet with information about what each customer did on the online store.

##   What You Need to Run This

To use this project, you'll need a few computer programs:

* **Python:** *The programming language I used.*
* **pandas:** *A tool for working with tables of data.*
* **scikit-learn:** *A set of tools for the "K-means clustering" method.*
* **matplotlib and seaborn:** *Tools for making charts and graphs.*

If you have Python installed, you can install the other tools by typing this into your computer:

```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
