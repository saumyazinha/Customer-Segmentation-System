The Customer Data
The project uses a dataset called "E-commerce Customer Behavior." It tells us about what customers do on an online store. The important things we look at are:

Customer ID: A unique number for each customer.
Purchase Date: When they bought something.
Items Purchased: How many things they bought.
Total Spending: How much money they spent.
Age: The customer's age.
Average Rating: The average rating they gave to products.
Discount Applied: Whether they used a discount.
Days Since Last Purchase: How long it's been since they last bought something.
How I Grouped the Customers
Here's how the computer grouped the customers:

Looking at the Data: I loaded the customer data into the computer and got familiar with it.
Getting the Data Ready:
I made sure there were no mistakes or missing information.

I made sure all the numbers were on a similar scale (so the computer treated them fairly).

Choosing What to Focus On: I decided which customer information was most important for grouping.
Finding the Right Number of Groups: I used methods to figure out the best number of groups.
Grouping the Customers: The computer used "K-means clustering" to put each customer into a group.
Understanding the Groups: I looked at each group to see what they had in common.
What This Means for the Business: I explained how the online store can use these groups to sell better.

The Different Customer Groups

The computer found 4 distinct groups of customers:

Group 0: Loyal Customers:
These customers are relatively young (average age 29).
They spend a moderate amount of money (average $690).
They buy a moderate number of items (average 12).
They give average ratings (around 4 out of 5 stars).
Crucially, they almost always use a discount.
It's been a moderate amount of time since their last purchase (45 days ago).
Recommendation: Focus on retaining them through a strong loyalty program that continues to provide discounts.

Group 1: High-Value Customers:
These customers are also relatively young (average age 29).
They spend the most money (average $1455).
They buy the most items (average 20).
They give the highest ratings (around 4.8 out of 5 stars).
They rarely use discounts.
It's been a short time since their last purchase (11 days ago).
Recommendation: These are your best customers! Offer them early access to new products and personalized recommendations.

Group 2: Older Discount Seekers:
These customers are the oldest (average age 39).
They spend the least amount of money (average $473).
They buy the fewest items (average 8).
They give the lowest ratings (around 3.3 out of 5 stars).
They use discounts about half the time.
It's been a moderate amount of time since their last purchase (31 days ago).
Recommendation: Try to re-engage them with targeted promotions and address their lower satisfaction.

Group 3: Potential Mid-Value Customers:
These customers are of average age (32).
They spend a good amount of money (average $983).
They buy a decent number of items (average 13).
They give good ratings (around 4.4 out of 5 stars).
They use discounts about half the time.
It's been a moderate amount of time since their last purchase (20 days ago).
Recommendation: Nurture these customers to become high-value customers by offering personalized recommendations and rewards.
By understanding these groups, the online store can:

Send the most relevant ads to each customer.
Show customers products they're most likely to buy.
Offer rewards that will encourage customers to buy more.
Improve customer satisfaction.
