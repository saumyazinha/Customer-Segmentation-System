# Customer Segmentation with K-Means Clustering

This project performs customer segmentation using K-means clustering in Python to identify distinct customer groups and enable targeted marketing strategies.

## Description

The goal of this project is to analyze customer data and segment customers based on their purchasing behavior and demographic characteristics. By grouping customers with similar traits, businesses can tailor their marketing campaigns, product recommendations, and customer service efforts to specific segments, ultimately improving customer satisfaction and increasing revenue.

The project utilizes the K-means clustering algorithm, a popular unsupervised machine learning technique, to discover inherent patterns in the data without requiring pre-defined labels.

## Files

* `Customer_Segmentation.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the complete analysis, including data loading, preprocessing, K-means clustering, and results visualization.
* `data/Mall_Customers.csv`: The customer dataset used for the analysis.

## Dependencies

The following Python libraries are required to run the code:

* Python 3.x
* pandas
* scikit-learn (sklearn)
* matplotlib
* seaborn

You can install these libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
