The Customer Data
The project uses a dataset called "E-commerce Customer Behavior." It tells us about what customers do on an online store. The important things we look at are:

Customer ID: A unique number for each customer.
Purchase Date: When they bought something.
Items Purchased: How many things they bought.
Total Spending: How much money they spent.
How I Grouped the Customers
Here's a simplified explanation of how the computer grouped the customers:

Looking at the Data: First, I loaded the customer data into the computer and took a quick look at it to understand what kind of information we had.
Getting the Data Ready:
I made sure there were no mistakes or missing information (if there were any).
I made sure all the numbers were on a similar scale (so the computer didn't give too much importance to big numbers).
Choosing What to Focus On: I decided which customer information was most important for grouping them. For example, "Total Spending" and "Items Purchased" are likely to be very important.
Finding the Right Number of Groups: I used two methods ("Elbow Method" and "Silhouette Analysis") to figure out the best number of customer groups to create. It's like finding the right number of boxes to sort things into.
Grouping the Customers: The computer used the "K-means clustering" method to automatically put each customer into one of the groups. Customers in the same group are very similar to each other.
Understanding the Groups: I looked at each group to see what they had in common. For example, one group might be customers who spend a lot of money and buy many items.
What This Means for the Business: Finally, I explained how the online store could use these groups to sell more effectively.
The Different Customer Groups
The computer found [Number of Clusters] different groups of customers:

Group 1: Big Spenders: These customers spend a lot of money and buy many things. The store should try to keep them happy by offering them special deals on new products.
Group 2: Bargain Hunters: These customers don't spend much money but buy a lot of items, possibly looking for discounts. The store could offer them coupons or sales.
Group 3: Occasional Buyers: These customers don't buy very often and don't spend much. The store might try to get them more interested with personalized recommendations.
(Add more groups as needed)
By understanding these groups, the online store can:

Send the right ads to the right people.
Recommend products that customers are likely to buy.
Make sure customers feel like the store understands them.
