# Grouping Customers to Sell Better (Customer Segmentation)

This project uses a computer technique to automatically group customers into different categories. This helps businesses understand their customers better and sell them products they're more likely to want.

## What's the Project About?

Imagine you're trying to sell clothes online. Some customers buy lots of expensive items, while others only buy cheap things on sale. If you treat everyone the same, you might not sell as much as you could!

This project uses a method called "K-means clustering" to automatically sort customers into groups based on what they buy and how they behave. This way, the online store can:

* Send special offers to the right groups of people.
* Show customers products they'll really like.
* Make sure everyone has a good shopping experience.

## What's Included?

* `Customer_Segmentation.ipynb`: This is a "digital notebook" that shows all the steps I took to group the customers. It includes the computer code and explanations.
* `data/E-commerce Customer Behavior.csv`: This is the file with the customer data. It's like a spreadsheet with information about what each customer bought.

## What You Need to Run This

To use this project, you'll need a few computer programs:

* **Python:** This is the programming language I used. Think of it as the language I used to talk to the computer.
* **pandas:** A tool for working with tables of data (like the customer spreadsheet).
* **scikit-learn:** A set of tools for doing things like "K-means clustering."
* **matplotlib and seaborn:** Tools for making charts and graphs to understand the data.

If you have Python installed, you can install the other tools by typing this into your computer:

```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
